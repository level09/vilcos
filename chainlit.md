# Vilcos Template Editor

This tool helps you create and edit website templates. Just describe what you want to change.

## Examples

- **Create**: "Create a new page called about.html with an about section"
- **Edit**: "Add a navigation bar to index.html"
- **Style**: "Update index.html to use a blue color scheme"
- **List**: "Show me all templates"

## Notes

- All edits are applied immediately without showing the code first
- Use "show me [filename]" to view a file's content
- Templates use Tailwind CSS for styling
