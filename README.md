**Vilcos transforms how you create and manage your website. Instead of a traditional CMS or a separate admin panel, your website gets its own dedicated, self-hosted AI web developer agent. Simply chat with it to build your initial site, make updates, manage content on any page, and evolve your entire project over time ‚Äì all through natural language!**

Vilcos is an AI-powered framework that empowers you to:
-   **Create & Build:** Generate new pages and entire site structures.
-   **Edit & Update:** Modify HTML, CSS (including Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, and importantly, the content within your pages.
-   **Manage & Evolve:** Iteratively refine your website, add new sections, or change layouts, much like a CMS, but through a conversational interface with your own AI agent.

This self-hosted agent acts as your personal web development assistant, understanding your requests and applying changes directly to your project files.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Website Management**: Use natural language to create, edit, and manage your entire website ‚Äì pages, content, and structure.
- **Live Preview**: See changes in real-time as you interact with your AI agent.
- **File Watching**: Automatic synchronization for instant feedback during development.
- **Static Publishing**: Generate optimized static sites ready for production.
- **Self-Hosted Agent**: You control the core AI agent framework.
- **Docker Deployment**: Simple deployment option available for the published static site.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/level09/vilcos.git
    cd vilcos
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *(Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and Node.js 16+ installed)*
    ```bash
    ./vilcos install
    ```

3.  **Configure OpenAI API Key:**
    Vilcos needs access to the OpenAI API.
    *   You can set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before starting:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
        ```
    *   Alternatively, when you run `./vilcos start` for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your API key. This key will be saved to a local `.env` file for future use.
    You can obtain an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

4.  **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    ./vilcos start
    ```

    This will automatically copy default templates to the `templates/` directory if none exist.
    The `templates/` directory is excluded from git to keep your repository clean.

Then access:
- **AI Management**: http://localhost:8000 (login: admin/password)
- **Website Preview**: http://localhost:3000

## Using the Application

In the AI Management Interface, you can:
- Create new pages by clicking "üÜï Create New Page" 
- Edit existing pages with the "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" buttons
- Preview your website with the "üîç Live Preview" button
- Publish your site with the "üì¶ Publish Website" button

### AI Chat Examples
- **Create**: "Create a new page called about.html with an about section"
- **Edit**: "Add a navigation bar to index.html"
- **Style**: "Update index.html to use a blue color scheme"
- **List**: "Show me all templates"

## Project Structure

```
vilcos/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Chainlit AI interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vilcos                 # Main command-line script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start.sh               # Development startup script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watch-templates.js     # Template file watcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ publish.sh             # Static site generator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.sh              # Docker deployment script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/             # Website templates (editable)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Default template
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/               # CSS and JS files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/                  # Development build (generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public/                # Production build (generated)
```

## Available Commands

```bash
./vilcos help      # Show available commands
./vilcos start     # Start all components
./vilcos ai        # Start Chainlit AI interface only
./vilcos dev       # Start website preview only
./vilcos watch     # Start file watcher only
./vilcos publish   # Generate static site
./vilcos deploy    # Deploy with Docker (simple, single container)
./vilcos logs      # View application logs
./vilcos clean     # Clean generated files
```

## Development Workflow

Vilcos operates in two distinct modes to support both development/editing and production deployment.

### 1. Development Mode (Edit & Preview)
1. **Develop and Edit**:
   - Use the AI-powered interface to create/edit templates
   - Preview changes in real-time

### 2. Production Mode (Static Publishing)
1. **Publish**:
   - When satisfied, publish your site as static files: `./vilcos publish`
2. **Deploy Locally**:
   - You have two options for Docker deployment:
     - **Quick deployment with pre-built files**: `./vilcos deploy -p` (uses existing files in dist/)
     - **Full deployment from source**: `./vilcos deploy` (builds the site inside Docker)
   - Benefit from improved performance and security

### 3. Cloud Deployment (Fly.io)
Vilcos includes ready-to-use configuration for deploying to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), a platform-as-a-service for running applications globally.

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install the [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/): `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`
   - Sign up and authenticate: `flyctl auth signup` or `flyctl auth login`

2. **Deploy to Fly.io**:
   ```bash
   # Launch a new app (first time only)
   fly launch
   
   # In the prompts, customize your app name and choose a region
   # Select 'No' to Postgres and Redis
   # Select 'Yes' to deploy now
   ```

3. **For subsequent updates**:
   ```bash
   # Redeploy after making changes
   fly deploy
   ```

Your site will be available at `https://your-app-name.fly.dev`.

## Troubleshooting

- **OpenAI API Key**: You'll be prompted for your key when starting; get one at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
- **Port Conflicts**: If ports 8000 or 3000 are in use, edit the port numbers in start.sh
- **Logs**: Check logs with `./vilcos logs` to diagnose issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 16+
- npm 8+
- OpenAI API key
